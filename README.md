# Track-and-Trigger

In modern household, due to hectic work schedules, it is quite difficult to remember as well as manage
the availability of mandatory commodities in an urban home. <br><br>
Not only working professionals, home-
makers, job-seekers, and others fail to keep track of their inventories or scheduled meetings which in
turn either delay or terminate their regular duties. Sometimes, most of the people forget that they already
have sufficient stock of certain item, and end up re-buying the same stuff again (toothpaste, soap, face
wash, etc.) as a result lose money and time. <br><br>
The inability of efficiently managing the home inventories
will not only impacts work schedules, but also causes stress, anger, and impatience. An automated
application is proposed and intended to develop in order to keep track of the regular activities and aid
people in managing the daily home inventories.
